# Shopping_purchase

Here a dictionary with two different kinds of edible item(chocolate, biscuit) of 15 each is created. And each items are nested with another dictionary consists of ID, type, cost, availablity and discount.

It is then stored in JSON file named Morning_items.

Then it is called again for using it for purchase.
After numerous customer bought their needs it is ***then stored in another JSON file called Night_items for viewing purpose.*** So we can see and update the requirement for further purpose.

The added feature in my code is ____Whenever the customer asks exceeding amount of items, it asks the customer that we have this amount only, is that ok!!!___ 
This makes ***us and the customer*** as well to know that we are out of stock!!

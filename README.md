# Shopping_purchase

Here a dictionary with two different kinds of edible item(chocolate, biscuit) of 15 each is created. And each items are nested with another dictionary consists of ID, type, cost, availablity and discount.

It is then stored in JSON file named Morning_items.

Then it is called again for using it for purchase.
After numerous customer bought their needs and printing their bills, it is ***then stored in another JSON file called Night_items for viewing purpose.*** So we can see and update the requirement for further purpose.

It is also coded to sell the product to the market. ***When the customer wants to sell the product, it is updated in that JSON file named night_items!!!***. They are coded in such a way that after buying things, they are given at 50% to the original price. If we want we can give more amount as well depends on the market :)...

***BOTH SELL AND PURCHASE ACT ARE SHOWN DIRECTLY AND THE DETAILS OF THE RECORDS ARE SHOWN IN THE BILLS, SO WE CAN SEE THE UPDATES.***


The added feature in my code is: 
1. ____Whenever the customer asks exceeding amount of items, it asks the customer that we have this amount only, is that ok!!!___ 
2. ***BOTH SELLING AND PURCHASING ARE DONE AT ONE STROKE...***


This makes ***us and the customer*** as well to know that we are out of stock!!
